		<h3 class="section-header">About</h3>
		<p class="section-block-text">
			I am a senior at Auburn University graduating Spring 2015. I'm working toward a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science.  I have practical experience in both engineering and software practices.  I am also an experienced web developer with an eye for good design.
		</p>
		<p class="section-block-text">
			I have a variety of interests and a few obsessions.  Although I am most passionate about mobile technology and software design, I also enjoy reading, writing, and watching films.  I watch movies all the time, and I love to dissect and discuss them to no end.  Of course, when I'm not consumed by a stack of unwatched DVDs, I also like to participate in and watch sports.  I've played ice hockey for most of my life, and I've also had a longstanding love of nature and outdoor sports. I've never played football, but I certainly watch Auburn like I do.

		<h3 class="section-header">Experience</h3>
		<p class="section-block-text">
			My software career started in high school, when I worked as a paid intern at Redstone Arsenal.  I worked primarily with CAD software during this internship, but the experience helped to prepare me for a life in front of the computer.  I started college after that internship, and my recent CAD experience helped me to earn a co-op position with SAIC.  I started in the 3D modeling department, but after a few months I wanted to try something new. So, I transfered to a software department and began working on a mobile web application. I was instantly hooked, and I knew that I had to pursue a career in web development.
		</p>
		<p class="section-block-text">
			As a result of my newfound interest in software, I decided to gain as much development experience as possible during my remaining semesters at Auburn. I finished co-op work during my junior year, and I decided to take on a Computer Science minor that semester.  The minor delayed graduation an extra semester, but luckily, it also led me to my current position as a UX Analyst at Intergraph.

		<h3 class="section-header">Skills</h3>
		<p class="section-block-text">
			Through a combination of schooling and practical experience, I've cultivated an extensive software skillset.  At Auburn, I worked with a variety of object-oriented languages, such as C++, Python, and Java.  I have also worked with SQL and web technologies for a few projects.  As an employee, I have largely devoted my efforts to web development and design.  I'm well-versed in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and I've built several websites using popular front end frameworks, such as Angular and Knockout.  I've also worked on both Android and iOS applications using Java and a cross-platform development tool called Titanium.
